Fast parallel Particle Swarm Optimization package for Python

__fastPSO__ is an open source software library for Particle Swarm Optimization built with two goals in mind:
  * Speed
  * Parallelism
  
Its flexible architecture enables you to define complex objective functions, and to perform optimization in a __serial__ or __parallel__ setting. In addition, it offers detailed insights on the optimization process, helping practitioners profile their results.

## Installation

__pip__ __package__

```
pip install fastpso
```

### Requirements

  * numpy

## Getting started

tbd

## License

__fastPSO__ is available under *MIT License*
